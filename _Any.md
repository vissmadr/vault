# Duelist

This aesthetic, closer to WoL?

I like it.

Gives more freedom when it's less dark.

Duels and the challenge makes sense.

Less edgy.

Does not need to involve killing.

The challenge inside one's mind world, with his dream NPCs inside.

Completing the dream and facing the dreamer last for a game loop.

# WoL Learning

Map is very annoying where it stops your fast running and makes you dash.

COMBOS COMBOS COMBOS COMBOS COMBOS COMBOS COMBOS COMBOS COMBOS...

The combo with ministun mechanic is a total game-maker. Like WoL and Had.

- And then there is the option to not play it lol, but play ranged/burn instead for example.

Relics/Talents are very cool.

Unlockable stuff is cool.
