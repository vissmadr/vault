# Big Study

Spent months of prerequisite learning to get ready for this project.

Technically years, considering the whole road before that.

# Sprite Drawing

`2025 10`

Learned how to draw sprites and use a drawing tablet.

Chose isometric 2.5D art for now.

Looks like even simple art can look very good when polished well.

_Lots of research._

Figuring ot what technologies I should use for the project.

Lots of YouTube, lots of DeepSeek.

Technologies in mind: `C`, `C++`, `OpenGL`, `Raylib`, `SDL3`, `ImGui`, `SQLite`, `GLFW`, `SFML`...

Trying to prototype in different ones to see how they work.

Struggling with the fact that C doesn't have namespacing.

Really struggling with C/C++ build systems.

Learning how the build process actually works.

_Lots of research._

Probably watched a hundred different videos on YouTube about various game development projects and technologies.

Randomly stumbled upon the Zig programming language.

Will check it out...

HOLY SHIT!

This is it.

It's funny how it's easier to setup and build a C/C++ library with Zig than it is with C/C++ build tools, lol.

Turns out you can very easily import Raylib into a Zig project and use it directly. This way I even have it enclosed in a namespace. And there are also custom Zig bindings for it. Magic!

Technologies in mind: `Zig`, `Raylib`

_Practice, practice, practice..._

Went through the full Raylib wiki.

Going through the `zig-raylib` package examples one by one to build a fundamental understanding before I dive in myself.
