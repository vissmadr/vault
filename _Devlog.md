# Big Study

Spent months of prerequisite learning to get ready for this project.

Technically years, considering the whole road before that.

# Sprite Drawing

`2025 10`

Learned how to draw sprites and use a drawing tablet.

Chose isometric 2.5D art for now.

Looks like even simple art can look very good when polished well.

# Account

`2025 10 14`

Accounts setup.

# Tech

`2025 10 17`

_Lots of research._

Figuring ot what technologies I should use for the project.

Lots of YouTube, lots of DeepSeek.

Technologies in mind: `C`, `C++`, `OpenGL`, `Raylib`, `SDL3`, `ImGui`, `SQLite`, `GLFW`, `SFML`...

Trying to prototype in different ones to see how they work.

Struggling with the fact that C doesn't have namespacing.

Really struggling with C/C++ build systems.

Learning how the build process actually works.

`2025 10 18`

_Lots of research._

Probably watched a hundred different videos on YouTube about various game development projects and technologies.

Randomly stumbled upon the Zig programming language.

Will check it out...

HOLY SHIT!

This is it.

It's funny how it's easier to setup and build a C/C++ library with Zig than it is with C/C++ build tools, lol.

Turns out you can very easily import Raylib into a Zig project and use it directly. This way I even have it enclosed in a namespace. And there are also custom Zig bindings for it. Magic!

Technologies in mind: `Zig`, `Raylib`

# Zig

`2025 10 19`

_Practice, practice, practice..._

Went through the full Raylib wiki.

Going through the `zig-raylib` package examples one by one to build a fundamental understanding before I dive in myself.

# Data Oriented Design

`2025 10 28`

Researching data oriented design, ECS, and software architecture.

It's good and I learned a ton.

Found out that it's not necessarily an all-in architecture. Things can be refactored into data oriented form later for better performance. So focus on building first.

# Raylib-Zig Examples

`2025 11 02`

Going back and completing the `zig-raylib` examples.

# Isometric Tilemap

`2025 11 06`

Figuring out how to do the isometric tilemap.

Should probably use Tiled, and then convert the data for the game.

# Tilemap Grid

`2025 11 07`

Learned how to use Tiled.

Playing around with exporting tilemap data and loading it in Zig.

Got a debug grid working, both rectangular and isometric.

# Perspective

`2025 11 08`

But what if I try 3D?

Imported a 3D model.

# Camera

`2025 11 09`

Got a 3D camera working.

Created a GUI for the camera control.
