**Her License**: About sharing images. Fucked up and forgot to ask.

**Player Items Problem**: Talk about the Player items problem.

- Should we go without this? Or should we try?
- Show her the artwork in `#engineering` lol.
- Dependent on her because of the modes art. If the character changes enough with mode switching then it's probably overkill to go for items.

**Pixel Composer**: Show her Pixel Composer if she's interested.

**Name**: Tell her about the name struggle. Now that we have an art direction we should begin searching.

**Hades Animations**: Talk about the post-fact animation style.
