## Cast-first

**Pros**:
Single tap to cast any spell.
Solves the stance switch spam problem.

**Cons**:
Cannot stance switch while spell is in cooldown.
Dilemma between casting a spell versus remaining in a stance.

**Timed Stance Idea**: The cast-first approach makes it possible for stances to remain for a duration only.
