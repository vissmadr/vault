# System

**System Files**: Located in the root directory and prefixed by a `_` symbol.

**Main Idea**: Create nodes, link them together, let structure emerge by itself.

**Adaptive**: The only sure way to scale and develop across time is to continually improve vault nodes.

**Atomic Nodes**: Each node should be an atomic note, meaning that it should strive to be an independent as-is idea.

**Context**: All nodes should have context. Context is the link to the bigger ideas the nodes are a subset of.

**Tags**: Nodes can have tags to specify what kind of node they are. Without tags, they are assumed to be atomic nodes by default.

Nodes Count: `983`
