# Artificial General Intelligence

Currently hypothetical form of true AI able to adapt and perform general intellectual tasks.

---

AGI refers to a level of machine intelligence that matches or exceeds human cognitive flexibility.

Unlike narrow AI systems that specialize in specific tasks, AGI would demonstrate robust general-purpose understanding.

True AGI would be able to learn new domains with minimal prior information, transfer knowledge across fields, and reason abstractly about unfamiliar situations.
