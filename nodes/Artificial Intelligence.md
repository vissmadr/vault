## Classification

**Broad Range**: The term AI can be very broad, as it might range from very simple human-deterministic logical systems to extremely complex non-human-deterministic ones.

Different kinds of systems considered AI:

- **Software in General**: Any computer logic that does stuff based on 'decisions' it makes.
- **[[Finite State Machine]]**: Can create complex yet human-deterministic behavior.
- **[[Neural Network]]**: Considered real AI, as it is somewhat modeled after human intelligence.
- **[[Large Language Model (LLM)]]**: Feels like true AI, as it is able to work with human language.
- **[[Artificial General Intelligence]]**: Currently hypothetical idea of general and adaptive true AI.

Compared to human intelligence, AI can probably be classified as:

- **Narrow**: Specialized in one task.
- **General AI**: Human-like intelligence across diverse tasks.
- **Superintelligence**: AI surpassing human intelligence and abilities.
