---

Boss Monster is a nostalgic, retro-themed card game (2-4 players) that flips the classic dungeon crawler concept:

- **Reverse dungeon crawler**: You play as the boss building a dungeon to defeat heroes
- **8-bit aesthetic**: Heavy homage to classic NES/SNES video games
- **Dungeon building**: Draft and play room cards to build a deadly left-to-right dungeon
- **Lure heroes**: Attract adventurers with treasure, then kill them with traps and monsters
- **Light strategy**: Easy to learn with some strategic depth in room placement
- **Player interaction**: Sabotage opponents and steal their heroes
- **Quick sessions**: Around 20-30 minutes per game
