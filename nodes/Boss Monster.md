**Reverse Dungeon Crawler**: You play as the boss building a dungeon to defeat heroes.

**8-bit Aesthetic**: Some of that good old school.

**Dungeon Building**: Draft and build different kinds of dungeon rooms.

**Lure Heroes**: Attract adventurers with treasure, then slay them with traps, spells, and monsters.

**Light Strategy**: Easy to learn with some strategic depth in room placement.

**Player Interaction**: Use spells and effects to sabotage the other players.

**Quick Sessions**: Around 15-30 minutes per game.
