# Boss Monster

ad

---

Boss Monster is a nostalgic, retro-themed card game (2-4 players) that flips the classic dungeon crawler concept:

- **Reverse dungeon crawler**: You play as the boss building a dungeon to defeat heroes
- **8-bit aesthetic**: Heavy homage to classic NES/SNES video games
- **Dungeon building**: Draft and play room cards to build a deadly left-to-right dungeon
- **Lure heroes**: Attract adventurers with treasure, then kill them with traps and monsters
- **Light strategy**: Easy to learn with some strategic depth in room placement
- **Player interaction**: Sabotage opponents and steal their heroes
- **Quick sessions**: Around 20-30 minutes per game

## **Roll Player**

Roll Player is a dice-manipulation and engine-building game (1-4 players) focused on character creation:

- **Unique premise**: The game IS character creation - you're building an RPG hero before the adventure
- **Dice drafting**: Draft colored dice each round and place them in your character sheet's attribute rows
- **Multiple goals**: Balance attribute scores, buy equipment, gain skills, and fulfill alignment/backstory objectives
- **Puzzle-like**: Very satisfying optimization puzzle as you manipulate dice values
- **Low conflict**: Mostly multiplayer solitaire with light competitive elements (market drafting)
- **Medium complexity**: More strategic than Boss Monster, with interesting decisions each turn
- **Playtime**: 60-90 minutes typically

**Overall Pattern**: You seem to enjoy games with **asymmetric powers** (Monolith Arena's factions), **tactical optimization** (Roll Player's dice manipulation), and **creative/quirky themes** (Boss Monster's reverse dungeon concept). Your wishlist (Mage Knight, Frosthaven, Aeon's End) suggests you're ready for heavier, more complex strategic experiences!
