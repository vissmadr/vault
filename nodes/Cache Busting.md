# Cache Busting

Technique used to force systems to load a new version of a file instead of using a previously cached one.

---

Often used in [[Web Browser|Web Brosers]], were the user may still receive the old cached version of a file instead of loading the new one.

Cache busting ensures the program sees the file as "new" and loads/downloads it again.

Common browser methods:

- Query string versioning
- Filename hashing
- Timestamp versioning
