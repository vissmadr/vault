# Composition Over Inheritance

Software design principle that favors code reuse by assembling existing components, rather than using [[Inheritance (OOP)|Inheritance]].

_"Ideally all reuse can be achieved by assembling existing components."_

_"Inheritance sucks."_

Composition promotes [[Modular Design]].

The key idea is to prefer creating smaller, reusable, and interchangeable components instead of building deep and rigid class hierarchies.
