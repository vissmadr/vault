# Entity Component System

Software architectural pattern, primarily used in [[Game Development]], that organizes game objects into entities, components, and systems.

---

**Entity**: Unique identifiers.
**Component**: Data without behavior.
**System**: Process that operates on an entity with specific components.

ECS follows the principle of [[Composition Over Inheritance]].
