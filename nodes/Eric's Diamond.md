# Eric's Diamond

Wisdom from one of my teachers.

> Your game is like the diamond shape.

> In the beginning, you start at the bottom and
> add to it, as much as you can.
>
> But at some point you're at the limit of how
> much more you can add while maintaining quality.
>
> Then you have to start closing again, removing
> the unnecessary while building your game.
