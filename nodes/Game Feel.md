# Game Feel

Describes the responsiveness, intuitiveness, and viscerality of a [[Game]].

---

The intangible, tactile sensation experienced when interacting with games.

## Seven Principles

Taken from the [Game Feel Book](https://gamifique.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2-game-feel.pdf)

- **Predictable Results**: When players take action, they get the response they expect.

- **Instantaneous Response**: The player feels the response to their input is immediate.

- **Easy But Deep**: The game takes minutes to learn but a lifetime to master.

- **Novelty**: Though the result of an input is predictable, there is enough subtlety and expressiveness to keep the controls feeling fresh and interesting through hours and hours of play.

- **Appealing Response** The sensation of control is aesthetically appealing and com-pelling, separate from context.

- **Organic motion**: Controlling the avatar creates appealing arcs of motion.

- **Harmony**: Each element of a gameâ€™s feel supports a single, cohesive perception of a unique physical reality for the player.
