# Game Prototyping

The purpose of game prototypes is playtesting.

**Answer Questions**: Prototypes should answer specific questions about the game. Test the things that matter. Don't waste time testing the things you already know the answer to.

**Minimum Sufficient**: Prototype only what is currently necessary. For example, two characters might be sufficient for the whole "character" area testing, which means there is no need to make ten of them.
