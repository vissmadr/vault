# Generator and Spender Mechanic

Fundamental [[Game Design]] concept about generating a resource and then spending it.

---

Having something that generates a resource, and something else that spends it.

Very useful when it comes to designing attack abilities and such.

Instead of using cooldowns or time-based resources, this mechanic can interlock things `A` and `B`, making `A` depend on the usage of `B`.
