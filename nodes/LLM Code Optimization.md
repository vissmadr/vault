# LLM Code Optimization

ad

---

Syntax matters a lot.

Prefer explicit code over implicit code.

**Optimal Style**: Idiomatic, conventional, explicit, boring, and internally consistent.

Optimizing code for AI is largely the same as optimizing code for humans—except the penalties for ambiguity are higher.

See: [[Cognitive Load Article]]

## Context

Provide desire and intent explicitly.

## Consistency

Extremely important factor.

**_Conventions and idioms matter more than originality._**

It's better to have a consistent way of doing things than having multiple different ways of doing thins, even if they seem better in theory.

**_LLMs are trained on conventional code, not clever code._**

Strongly preferred:

- Standard library patterns
- Idiomatic language constructs
- Widely used frameworks in canonical form

## Comments

**_Comments help when they explain why, not what._**

LLMs already know what code does syntactically.
