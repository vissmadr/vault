# Lessons From Casey Muratori

Lessons learned from Casey Muratori.

**Explore and Lock**: Do not look too far ahead. Just explore and write code without thinking about the encompassing structure too much. Lock onto what is good.

**Separation of Code**: Software architecture, in practice, is separation of code. The purposes of that separation:

- code reuse
- mental clarity
- division of labor

> "It actually looks like im better at math on the screen than I actually am. Probably because I am covering things that I know really well. When I'm actually working out new math stuff it's atrocious. It's a disaster zone all the time."
