# Lessons From Tim Ruswick

Lessons learned from Tim Ruswick.

---

Prototype hard. Not only one thing, but many, and keep them fast and simple.

Don't chase trends. Make the game you want to play.

Do one thing really really well instead of trying to do everything.

Mechanics & Fun > Realism.

Aesthetic Style > Graphics.

- (talking about good color palettes and stuff)

Get HONEST feedback.

- Problems they point out are usually valuable, but their solutions are usually not.
- Make sure to ask the people that are actually interested in the genre!

Focus on the front as everyone plays the start, but not everyone finishes the game.
