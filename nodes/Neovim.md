_King._

[[Free and Open Source]]

Neovim is based on [[Vim]], but rebuilt for extensibility and efficiency.

**Conceptually Mature**: Builds on the lessons learned from Vim and its design.

**Hyperextensible**: Neovim is extremely extensible by design. Allows for the integration [[Lua]] plugins.

**Configurable**: Allows for the customization of just about anything. Neovim configuration is easy to create, manage, and reuse.

**Efficiency**: Combining the Vim system with hyperextensibility and configurability, Neovim becomes one of the most efficient ways to navigate and edit text using a keyboard.
