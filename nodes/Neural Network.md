# Neural Network

Computational structure of interconnected nodes that learns patterns by adjusting weighted connections.

---

The neural network is a machine learning architecture inspired by the structure of biological neurons.

Consists of nodes (often called 'neurons') that transform input data through weighted connections and nonlinear activation functions.

The network adapts these weights during training.

The power of neural networks lies in their ability to generalize from examples, but they require substantial data and training.
