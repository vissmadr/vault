# Project Spellblade - Input

Game input and player controls.

---

The required controls of the game include:

- Menu (also a pause)
- Movement
- Orbs (`3` in total)
- Attack

**No Target Pointer (?)**: The game shouldn't need any kind of pointer devices, as the movement changes the character direction and is sufficient for melee combat and aiming spells.

**Optional Attack Hold (?)**: Holding the attack button could be made to optionally chain it, reducing the required spam.

## Keyboard

Can be modified.

**Menu**: `Esc`
**Movement**: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`
**Orbs**: `J`, `K`, `L`
**Attack**: `I`

## Touchscreen

**Menu**: Corner button.
**Movement**: Left circle.
**Orbs**: Right buttons.
**Attack**: Right button.
