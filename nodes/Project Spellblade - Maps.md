## Mutations

- The WORLD can mutate, while the player remains the same.
- Cool idea: If the run has say 5 floors, each floor has its own mutation. They can be progressively more volatile. And then final boss room mutation.
- Mutations can have pros/cons, or only cons, where if you defeat the elite that 'owns' the mutation - it stops.
- Or multiple elites per floor, each contributing to the mutation, so that it's not an assassination hit-and-run gameplay from floor to floor.
- This way you can choose your own speed. The faster you are (skipping stuff) - the harder it is.
- Instead of enemies slain %, it can also be Elite NPC's that need to be defeated, like mini-bosses that change the effects.
- Global modifiers, like wet air, or something.

Short runs: Can go without in-run scaling.
Long runs: Probably good to have _something_.

## Biomes

Biomes that affect the whole run, meaning both player and enemies.

Examples:

- Cold Biome: -10% movespeed, -10% attackspeed, +10% fire resistance.

## Stance Environment Effects

Fire stance removes slows due to cold environment.
