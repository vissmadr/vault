# Project Spellblade - Stances

Game design concerning the stances in the game.

---

_Base, Fire, Earth, Storm, Chaos._

Upon stance activation:

- **Entry**: Ability that gets activated upon stance entry.
- **Effects**: Duration-based buffs that begin on stance entry and can expire.
- **Passives**: Persistent buffs that are active while the stance is active.

There can be slots that you put abilities/effects/passives in for each stance, or it can all be unlocked by talents/items. Or both?

**Cooldowns**: The 4 elemental stances have their own cooldowns each.
