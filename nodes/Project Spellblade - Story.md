# Project Spellblade - Story

The story of the game.

---

Death: Could wake up (respawn) every time near the beggar (Sage), who comments on the way you died and possibly makes fun of you.

---

In the end world kinda tells you, or at least lets you deduce about the ending/hard reset.

Lord has a reason to stay - a child maybe? Like last 10 years was growing. Look at the guardian from Furi and his child.

- Choice 1: Ascend.
- Choice 2: Dethrone - keep preserving the world.
- Choice 3: Let Lord's child ascend, while you and the dying Lord (now grateful) remain and watch the world end.

(Optionally) When the Lord first reached the End, he was with a party (his friends/clan/brotherhood).

- He just found out about his child.
- He/they just found out about the nature of the World.

Suddenly he wanted to abort the mission.
But the party refused.
So he slayed/burned them all.

- Still feels the guilt of that day.

Sage:

A: Sage is the World personification.

- The world talks to you, as this is Sage.
- He understands the purpose, as well as the Sin.
- Morpheus: I can show you the way, but cannot walk it for you.
- Was the teacher of the Lord, too.

B: Sage was one of the Lord's first party.

All to train the Player.

To do the impossible.

---

Heavily reliant on secrets & indirection. To find the story instead of being told the story.

**World**:

- The world is a transient one.
- Dark one. Like training grounds that breed toughness, although the citizens have adapted to it and even found comfort. _Something like the fremen._
- The purpose of the world, like a function, is to return a complete self - one that is fit to carry on to the next world.
- Public Belief: The world exists to forge a "complete self", granting virtues.
- Hidden Truth: The world is a filter, not a forge. It does not create completeness. Only provides test that might prove completeness.
- Environmentally, the world has different biomes, each of which posing different challenges to the living.
- The world provides challenges/tests that one could complete. Test of Might, Agility, Spirit, Strength, Wisdom, Courage...
- Completing challenges/tests is how creatures usually advance in the world.
- The World does not exist to be saved. It exists to be left behind.

**Reset**:

- The one who successfully leaves the World causes it to reset.
- Leave without taking anything with you. No legacy. No memory perserved. No proof you existed.

**City**:

- The place where heroes survive together.
- Evolved enough to have small-scale trade.
- Hideout against the Lord.
- (secret) The City survives because the Lord allows it - it keeps heroes contained.

**Guardians**:

- Sentinels that face heroes as the last challenge before completing a Test.
- Wise, not vicious, aware of their role in the world.
- Guardians ask questions.
- Guardians speak of wisdom and letting go.
- (secret) A Guardian has never struck first in recorded history.

**Champions**:

- Sentinels that face heroes as the last challenge before completing a Test.
- Mostly vicious and power-hungry.
- Given power by the Lord.
- Obedient to the Lord.
- Champions make declarations.
- Champions speak of glory and eternity.

**Lord**:

- Tyrant that dominates over the world.
- Intelligent and extremely powerful.
- Was once a hero himself.
- Tries to prevent, or make it very difficult, for heroes to complete the world challenges/tests.
- Wants to permanently destroy all Guardians and control the challenges/tests so that none may challenge his rule.
- (rumor) Has failed the final Test of Purity/Death, deciding to stay and rule over the world instead of leaving it.
- Did not want to exit. Does not want a reset. Wants to save/preserve his World, and all the people within it. Wants to be remembered.
- (secret) Is not evil, but on the different side of the dilemma.
- (secret) He cares more about the people and his legacy than he cares about the nature of the World.
- (secret) Does not accept letting go of the world.
- (draft #2) Completed the world, and upon Reset lost a loved one. She was also Reset and did not remember him. Swore to never again.
- Reached the exit, but chose not to pass.

**Sin**:

- By controlling Tests, the Lord freezes the World in a perpetual almost-ready state.
- The World itself is decaying because it was never meant to persist this long.

**Sage**:

- Legendary status of the one who is wisest.
- (1 rumor) Is dead or hiding.
- (2 rumor) The teacher of the Lord himself.
- (3 rumor) The first worthy who could exit the world.
- (4 rumor) Decided to be the last to exit, so that he may shepherd all of the others first.
- (5 rumor) Betrayed by his pupil. The pupil was supposed to exit, but he chose to Lord over the world instead.
- (hidden truth) Sage has already exited the world. Accepted being forgotten. Knows that staying broke the rules.

**Beggar**:

- Beggar that can be found in the city or in the world.
- Hooded, old, beard, old robes/rags.
- Something about him that suggests more than meets the eye.
- The player can interact with him, giving him a small amount of currency for a wise quote or piece of advice.
- (secret) The beggar is Sage himself.

**True Sage**:

- Never gives direct answers.
- The Sage is not truly hiding. He is testing recognition without authority.
- The World itself recognizes the sage, but the Heroes/citisenz don't remember him. Only the legend remains.
- Animals behave differently near him.
- Has powers that don't even make sense, but doesn't use them.
- (secret) He is not waiting for the Lord to fall - he is waiting for someone to surpass him.
- Knows the dilemma of the World, and knows about the Sin. But even though he understands, is wise enough to see the nature of the World, and that the World is only an illusion. Only a process to get one ready for the real world. Lord could not make that sacrifice.

**Choice**:

- Finally, the Player can dethrone the Lord and become him.
- (Ng+ mechanic) The player can leave - and the world continues without ever acknowledging it.
