# Project Spellblade - Story

The story of the game.

---

Heavily reliant on secrets & indirection. To find the story instead of being told the story.

**World**:

- The world is a transient one.
- Dark one. Like training grounds that breed toughness, although the citizens have adapted to it and even found comfort. _Something like the fremen._
- The purpose of the world, like a function, is to return a complete self - one that is fit to carry on to the next world.
- Environmentally, the world has different biomes, each of which posing different challenges to the living.

**Sage**:

**Beggar**:
- Beggar that can be found in the city or in the world.
- Hooded, old, beard, old robes/rags.
- Something about him that suggests more than meets the eye.
- The player can interact with him, giving him a small amount of currency for a wise quote or piece of advice.

Child to escape the world.

One fraction wants to preserve the world.

The others are close, they want to escape.

Fight them.

But they start to make sense too.

In the end, make a choice between the two. Be the final guardian preserving the world, or be the chosen one transcending as the system was designed.

Hide the story.

Have characters, like the previous guardian, be glorified. Sage too.

The goal is to exit/escape/return.

The world, like a function, to return the complete self.

Some know this, and split into factions.

One faction wants to complete the world as the main purpose of it.

The other faction does not. It wants to preserve the world and the immortality it provides.

Sage knows the answers.

He knows that even the factions are by design.

To complete the world, one must be ready.

To be ready, he must complete all challenges.

Many have tried, many have failed, many have abandoned.

Another stands in the end, to defend the last gate.

He who defeats him can either choose to complete the world, or reset all gates and defend them himself.
