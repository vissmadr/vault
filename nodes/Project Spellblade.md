Designing a hack & slash melee mage game.

Attacks interact with the effects of spells.

#wip Combat & survival as Sage said it's evidently the best way to learn.
#wip Perk system in addition to other stuff, where you pick x out of y perks. For example 3 out of a list of 10, and they can be changed.

#wip house: Consider having a base that you can upgrade (Hades-like, also POE-like). Upgrades give some stuff.

#wip effects such as light, shadow, fog (think Uriel), rain, etc. Brings life to the scene.

#wip ground clutter stuff - grass, trees (flammable), etc.

**Tags**: Cross-platform, Top-down, Roguelite, Hack & Slash.
