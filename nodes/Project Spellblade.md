## Druid and Others

Consider multiple classes or games.

Druid with the QWE mechanics morphing into other forms. The A applies depending on form.

Ranged spellcaster with the QWE ones and shoot on A maybe.

Spellblade with QWE for spells and melee on A with heavy combos.

Warrior with QWE for attacks each, and QWE mechanics for attack/movement combos.
