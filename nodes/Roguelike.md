**Engine Building**: The process of building your own thing (like a character) which you then apply to the game.

#wip
Roguelikes can allow to squash the time it takes to progress a character compared to an RPG (like 20+ hours) and squash it into a run (like 20 minutes).

#wip
Experimenting and building is probably the heart of these games.

#wip
Agro-based builds or Control-based builds. Allow players to choose.
