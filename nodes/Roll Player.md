## **Roll Player**

Roll Player is a dice-manipulation and engine-building game (1-4 players) focused on character creation:

- **Unique premise**: The game IS character creation - you're building an RPG hero before the adventure
- **Dice drafting**: Draft colored dice each round and place them in your character sheet's attribute rows
- **Multiple goals**: Balance attribute scores, buy equipment, gain skills, and fulfill alignment/backstory objectives
- **Puzzle-like**: Very satisfying optimization puzzle as you manipulate dice values
- **Low conflict**: Mostly multiplayer solitaire with light competitive elements (market drafting)
- **Medium complexity**: More strategic than Boss Monster, with interesting decisions each turn
- **Playtime**: 60-90 minutes typically
