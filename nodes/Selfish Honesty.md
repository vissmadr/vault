# Selfish Honesty

Honesty might actually be selfish behavior.

---

1. People generally don't want to hear the truth. They prefer hearing what suits them.
2. Being honest is mostly a personal benefit, as it makes a person feel better about himself.
3. Honesty is the easy and lazy way out, because unlike lying, you don't have to remember stuff.

From this point of view, only a selfish person would be honest.

Now examine a lying altruist:

1. Makes his friends and family feel good by telling them exactly what they want to hear.
2. Sacrifices his selfish need for self-esteem, allowing him to be of better use to others.
3. Invests time and effort into remembering, developing, and maintaining the lies he has told.

It seems that the honesty I'm trying so hard to maintain only makes me worse in the eyes of most.
