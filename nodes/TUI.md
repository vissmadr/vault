# TUI

(Terminal User Interface)

Text-based user interface that runs within a [[Computer Terminal]], providing interactive visual elements using text characters.

---

Works by displaying text-based graphics, windows, and controls in the terminal environment.

**Control**: Allows for interactive navigation and manipulation through keyboard input and text-based UI elements.

**Resource Efficiency**: Generally more resource-efficient than a [[GUI]], and more interactive than a [[CLI]], providing visual feedback without graphical rendering overhead.
