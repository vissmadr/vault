# Utility-first Development

Software development paradigm focused on building good utilities (debugging tools, helper systems) along with the software itself.

---

Proper utilities can be a great benefit to development, design, and clarity.

**Complexity**: Some systems are complex enough that developing them without the right tools can be a nightmare.

**Time**: The time it takes to build a utility can often be less than the time it takes to build (and debug) something without the utility.

**Clarity**: Good tools can preempt many bugs by exposing hidden issues early.
