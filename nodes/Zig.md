# Zig

General-purpose low-level programming language.

---

Designed for optimality, robustness, maintainability, and clarity.

**Properties**: General-purpose, low-level, systems-level, compiled, statically typed, high-performance, portable.

**C Relation**: Designed to be a successor to [[C (Programming Language)]]. Zig can incrementally replace pieces of C code.

## Zen

- Communicate intent precisely.
- Edge cases matter.
- Favor reading code over writing code.
- Only one obvious way to do things.
- Runtime crashes are better than bugs.
- Compile errors are better than runtime crashes.
- Incremental improvements.
- Avoid local maximums.
- Reduce the amount one must remember.
- Focus on code rather than style.
- Resource allocation may fail; resource deallocation must succeed.
- Memory is a resource.
- Together we serve the users.
